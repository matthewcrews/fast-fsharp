<a class=anchor href=#fast-f-001-alpha>#</a></h1><p>I am obsessed with performance, and I have longed for a book on writing fast F# code. There are some resources out there, but nothing that went to the depth I am interested in. I want to take the same passion that C++ developers take to low latency code and apply it to the F# language. Some may scoff and say this is foolish. I find the challenge interesting.</p><p>I hope that this book will result from collaboration across the F# community. I plan to publish new chapters at a study pace and solicit feedback from the community. I fully anticipate being wrong a great deal of the time. I would rather present my ideas and learn from my mistakes than remain in my ignorance. If you have an idea or suggestion, I want to hear it!</p><h2 id=whos-this-for>Who&rsquo;s this for?
<a class=anchor href=#whos-this-for>#</a></h2><p>This book is targeted at intermediate F# developers. You&rsquo;ve already learned a bit of the language and now you want to know how to get the most performance out of F#. When I say performance, I am referring to single-threaded code that runs in the least amount of time possible. I don&rsquo;t plan to cover things like <code>async</code> or multi-threading. I don&rsquo;t use them in my work so I don&rsquo;t have as much experience. I am primarily concerned with how fast code runs. I would welcome collaborators who do feel like they could provide an expert&rsquo;s opinion 😊.</p><h2 id=what-this-book-is-not>What this book is NOT!
<a class=anchor href=#what-this-book-is-not>#</a></h2><p>I think it&rsquo;s important to state upfront that this is not a book on &ldquo;proper&rdquo; F# style. We may choose to model things in a way that is less elegant for the sake of achieving higher performance. There are already several excellent books that teach how to write succinct, beautiful, and clean code. I refer you to them and their superior teaching. If you find yourself want to make F# go fast though&mldr; I&rsquo;ll be waiting 😉.</p><h2 id=layout-and-structure>Layout and Structure
<a class=anchor href=#layout-and-structure>#</a></h2><p>This book will be a blend of theory and practice. The first half will focus on the internals of the F# language, the F# compiler, and the CLR. We will gain a deep knowledge of exactly how types work in F# and the implication on the performance of our code.</p><p>Once we have laid the groundwork, we will go into case studies. The case studies I will write are motivated by real-world problems. They will show how I went from an initial first draft and then used profiling and benchmarking to improve the performance.</p><h2 id=want-to-help>Want to help?
<a class=anchor href=#want-to-help>#</a></h2><p>I welcome other authors and editors. If you have something that you think would add value, I want it! Each chapter will note the author, so readers will know when they hear from a different voice. The book is not meant to be formal, so don&rsquo;t worry about having to create the most polished content. I hope that this feels like a conversation for those reading it.</p><p>If you would like to contribute, the books repo is <a href=https://github.com/matthewcrews/fast-fsharp>here</a>. You can reach out to me at my email (<a href=mailto:matthew@crews.email>matthew@crews.email</a>) or on Twitter, @McCrews.</p><p>This book is a Hugo website using the <a href=https://github.com/alex-shpak/hugo-book#installation>Hugo-Book</a> theme, so all you need to contribute is to be able to write some Markdown!</p><p>I also welcome technical review. I want to know if I have misstated something or could dramatically improve my algorithms!</p><h2 id=publishing-plan>Publishing Plan
<a class=anchor href=#publishing-plan>#</a></h2><p>This book will be authored in the open, and this digital version will <strong>always</strong> remain free. This book is my gift to the F# community for tolerating my endless questions. I may offer it as a physical book just because I&rsquo;d like to have a physical copy, but that is a long way.</p></article><footer class=book-footer><div class="flex flex-wrap justify-between"><div><a class="flex align-center" href=https://github.com/matthewcrews/fast-fsharp/edit/master/fast-fsharp/content/_index.md target=_blank rel=noopener><img src=/svg/edit.svg class=book-icon alt=Edit>
